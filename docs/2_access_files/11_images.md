## Single JPEGs

Note: Create JPEGs for any scans or born-digital images that are two pages or less and do not have significant printed text. For documents with significant printed text, and/or documents that are longer than two pages, create access PDFs following instructions below.

1. Open each scanned TIFF in Adobe Photoshop, (if working from a scan, use the Crop Tool to select the material, leaving a little bit of space but cutting off the targets).

2. Select the "File" menu then choose "Save as." 

*   Leave the filename the same and choose JPEG from the ‘format’ dropdown menu
*   Save file
*   Select ‘12’ for Quality (Maximum) and make sure ‘Baseline (“Standard”)’ is selected under ‘Format Options’ then click OK. 

3. You should end up with a TIFF including targets and a cropped JPEG without targets for each scan (and they should have the same file name).

## Batch JPEGs 

1. Open Adobe Bridge CS5 (part of Adobe Design Standard CS5).

*   The program opens up a window that shows folder navigation (at the top and left \
hand side), content – a selected location (in the middle), and a preview and \
metadata fields on the right. (The “Essentials” view – other views can be selected \
at the top right of the screen.)

2. Navigate to the location of the files you which to convert from tiff to jpg. 

*   Using the folder structure on the left and/or the content window in the middle. 

3. Select the image/s you wish to run the conversion on. 

4. Go to Tools  Photoshop > Image Processor 

*   This opens Adobe Photoshop CS5 

5. Choose Image Processor settings 

*   Do not have to open the first image to apply settings but you can 
*   Select the location in which you want to save the jpgs (default is same folder) 
*   Choose the file type: Save as JPEG – Quality 12 
*   Under preferences, choose Include ICC Profile. (for color calibration) 
*   Click Run 

6. Adobe Photoshop will run through each selected photograph and do the conversion. 

7. When the conversion is complete, you can close Photoshop and Bridge and find your newly converted images in your specified location. They will be in a folder called “JPEG”.
