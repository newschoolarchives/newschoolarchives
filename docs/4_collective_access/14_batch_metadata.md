# Overview 

Batch Imports only occur when more than 10 digital files need to be uploaded to Collective Access. To read more about this policy, review [Workflow: Scan Request Processing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QFmm7WE7VZE7eiDa2X7ECUW-AXxvXZSACsivlVrgT2w/edit).

There are three templates to use for importing data when batch creating new records.

# Stage 1. Creating Metadata


## Step 1: Prepare a metadata spreadsheet for Scan Tech to use while digitizing material

At minimum, the supervisory archivist will complete the following field for Scan Tech before they begin digitizing material: 


##### **Collection** 

*   Format:  
    *   Use collection or series identifier.
*   Example:
    *   Institute for Retired Professionals **collection** would be: NS022101
    *   Report of the Commission on Older Students at the New School for Social Research **series** would be:  NS022101_000006


## Step 2: Scan Tech completes fields while scanning

In the interest of quality control, descriptive metadata should be created by a worker other than the Scan Tech. The only fields to be completed by the Scan Tech while digitizing, will be: 


##### **Media Filename**


*   Format:
    *   The filename is derived from the resource identifier created in Archivistsâ€™ Toolkit (Resources > Series > Resource Identifier). 
*   Example: 
    *   Sample Resource Identifier: NS.03.01.05
    *   Sample Filename: NS030105_000173 (000173 is the scan number)
*   Multi-page documents will have pages added with an underscore 
    *   Sample Filename: NS030105_000173_pg01
    *   Sample Filename: NS030105_000173_pg02


##### **box #, folder # (if applicable)**


*   Format/Example: 
    *   box 5, folder 24


## Step 3. Quality Assurance

While completing the batch upload spreadsheet, Scan Tech should simultaneously check accuracy and quality of files (scans). 


*   QA Checklist: 
    *   Review that all pages are present 
    *   Confirm whether any images are missing data
    *   Check that pages do not need to be rotated, etc.


## Step 4. Supervisory archivist completes metadata

The supervisory archivist will either complete the remaining metadata, or assign a student to this job. The metadata formatting is outlined in the adjacent tabs of the template.
