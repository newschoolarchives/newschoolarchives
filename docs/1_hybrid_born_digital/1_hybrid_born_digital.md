# Introduction

The status of the various processes described in this document are communicated and tracked via the [Disk Inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mNAgjEYjdHNR-sLehjg5YafFLu3W-U-SWUbc39D55-8/edit#gid=426583852) by the Processing Archivist and Digital Archivist.

Workflows related to removable media will differ somewhat based upon whether the disks are from a collection that has been in the archives for some time, or whether they have arrived more recently. Most of the processes described in this document at the moment relate to legacy disks that have already been removed from collections and are stored in the Digital Archives office in “D” boxes. These processes also apply, with a couple of differences, to disks in PIC Mixed boxes. Many of these processes will also apply to disks that remain mixed in with physical collections.


## _A Note on Terminology_

For the purposes of clarity, in this manual and in communications between Processing and Digital Archivist, **_migration_** refers to the initial imaging and extraction of files from all legacy external media (including, but not limited to, floppy disk, CD, DVD). **_Transfer_** refers to all subsequent copying and moving of files into and between directories on the network drive.

## _Sequence Overview_

_Separation of Disks from Physical Collection_

*   For new accessions, Processing Archivist flags disks upon accession, leaving disks in place until ready for appraisal.
*   For legacy accessions, separation may already have occurred--disks will either be in a “D” box in the Digital Archives Office, or in a PIC mixed disk box in the Main Archives. (Update: as of April 2019, the PIC mixed boxes have been appraised and moved to the Digital Archives for migration.)

↓

_Appraisal_

*   Carried out by Processing Archivist after initial collection inventory has been created in an AT resource record, during processing of physical collection. 

↓

_Description in AT_

*   Initial description and location information to be carried out by Processing Archivist in tandem with appraisal.
*   Further description to be carried out following file migration, during processing processing of a collection.

↓

_Media Processing (Migration and Transfer)_

*   Carried out by Digital Archivist in tandem with appraisal by Processing Archivist.

↓

_Cataloging in CA (when applicable--not all media will be uploaded to CA)_


*   Carried out by either Digital Archivist (minimal record) or Processing Archivist (minimal or enhanced record).

↓

_Upload to CA (when applicable))_

*   If 1-10 disks, sometimes carried out by Processing Archivist.
*   If >10, carried out in batch by Digital Archivist.

## _Disk Inventory_

*   Track all actions in [Disk Inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mNAgjEYjdHNR-sLehjg5YafFLu3W-U-SWUbc39D55-8/edit#gid=426583852) as you go. This is especially important because there are discrete sets of activities carried out at various stages by the Processing Archivist and the Digital Archivist. Confirm with Digital Archivist which tab is the correct one to use.
*   During appraisal, Processing Archivist completes relevant fields in disk inventory. When completed, she alerts Digital Archivist, who migrates disks that are to be retained (as well as, upon the Processing Archivist’s request) disks that cannot be previewed prior to migration, and discards disks (through [Techno Trash](http://www.greendisk.com/gdsite/pack-ITservices.aspx)) that Processing Archivist indicates are not to be retained. 
*   Once all processes are complete for the disks in a collection, upon approval by the Processing Archivist, Digital Archivist moves rows from the collection to a separate spreadsheet and stores spreadsheet in the collection file on the shared server. 


# Breakdown of sequence

## _Assigning Disk Identifiers / Separating Disks_

Disks may have already been separated and assigned identifiers--if so, proceed to _Appraisal_.

### Conduct basic inventory of the collection:

### Creating disk identifiers:

*   Disk identifiers should be formatted as follows: [ **accession** ID] _ ”D” (for disk) + (three digit number) ( ex: 2014NS33_D001 ).


### Disk(s) not yet ready to be appraised, when there is accession record _only_:

When a collection is accessioned and an accession record is being created, follow these guidelines for documenting the presence of removable media in a collection. Processing Archivist:

*   Place loose CDs and DVDs into plastic or paper sleeves.
*   For disks in folders, _leave disk in place_ in folder. Insert a paper flag. Indicate disk identifier (or range of identifiers) on flag, using naming convention described above. Note that it is not necessary to individually identify each disk at this time--list as a range (ex: 2014NS33_D001-D032).
*   In AT accession record inventory note, record disk ID (or range of IDs) present in the collection.
*   Add disk or range of disks into Disk Inventory. It is not necessary to create a row for each disk at this time, they can be listed in a single row as a range (ex. 2014NS33_D001-D032)


### Disk(s) not yet ready to be appraised, but where an AT resource record and collection inventory is being or has been created (when the collection is not yet undergoing further processing):

When a resource record and a collection inventory is being or has been created, but no further processing will be done yet beyond creating the inventory, follow these guidelines for recording the presence of removable media in a collection. Processing Archivist:



*   In collection inventory of AT resource record, Processing Archivist records the disk or range of disk identifiers in a Repository Processing Note in the AT resource record, as follows:
    *   For disks present in a folder with other materials, the component where the note is to be added is the component for the folder.
    *   For folders containing disk(s) _only, _add folder title (or title drawn from disk inscription) as component.
    *   For disks that do not have a folder (i.e., they came in a separate box or were loose in a box), create a single AT component for all of the disks, assigning a temporary title to the component.
*   For ALL of the above, add a Repository Processing Note, indicating the disk identifier or range of identifiers.
*   Create instance in AT indicating the current location of disk(s).
*   Record ID, inscription, title, and other information in Disk Inventory in the tab named, “New Media.” \
(IMPORTANT: If the AT inventory is long and complex, make sure in the Disk Inventory to indicate where in the AT inventory the disk information has been added--do this in Column I, “Series or Other Indication of Location in AT Inventory.” Otherwise, later, when the collection is to be processed, the archivist will  have to scroll through every single component to find the Repository Processing Note that indicates the presence of disks.)


### Appraising disk(s) (by this time there will be an existing AT resource record with a collection inventory completed or in process). The Processing Archivist:



*   Places loose CDs and DVDs into plastic or paper sleeves.
*   If disks do not yet have ID, assigns ID based on **accession** no. formatted as follows: [accession ID]_”D” [for disk]+[three digit number] (ex: 2014NS33_D001). (Only disks to be retained should be given identifiers, although some disks to be deaccessioned may already have been assigned identifiers.) 
*   For disks present in a folder with other materials, remove flag from folder (if there is one), make certain there is a component for the folder in AT. Create separation sheet, print and put separation sheet into folder; save electronic version of separation sheet in collection file.
*   For folders containing disk(s) _only, _add folder title (or title drawn from disk inscription) to AT as a component, then discard physical folder; create separation sheet, print and put separation sheet in place where folder was; save electronic version of separation sheet in collection file.
*    Indicate disk identifier or range of identifiers (if not assigned, follow instructions above--note that Disk IDs are based upon _accession _number) -- associate disks with existing series if one can be determined, otherwise create temporary disk series.
*   For boxes containing disk(s) _only_, there is no need to create a separation sheet. Add box identification as a component in AT.
*   Remove disks for appraisal--it is not necessary to label individual disks at this time, but make sure the that disk identifier/range is kept with the disk(s) or that box(es) of disks are adequately labeled with a temporary label indicating range of Disk IDs in the box.
*   In ALL of above cases, at component level in AT, add Repository Processing Note field indicating disk ID# or range of ID#s.
*   Create instance in AT indicating current location of disk(s).
*   Update Disk Inventory with current location 

    of disks, even when location is temporary. It is not necessary to create an individual row for each disk per accession ID at this time--indicate disk ID or range.

## _Appraisal / Description in AT_

### While processing is in progress (after AT resource record has been created):

Processing Archivist appraises disks at a point after physical collection has been fully inventoried, before finding aid has been finalized, i.e. during STEP 2.

When possible, Processing Archivist reviews floppy disks using QuickViewPlus (currently only on computer at desk near the cart), prior to disk imaging and extraction (i.e., migration), or on an external CD/DVD reader, prior to migration. 

At this stage, Processing Archivist makes decisions about electronic records: whether they are to be retained; if they are to be retained, whether they are to be uploaded to Collective Access (may postpone this decision), or only made available onsite (or emailed to patrons, at discretion of Archivist). \


If Processing Archivist is rehousing the disks at this stage, s/he must make certain to transcribe any important information from the disk sleeve before discarding it. 

**_Collection inventory_**

Sometimes electronic files (ER) will be entered into the finding aid as independent components; other times, when an ER and physical files are integrated and the title is the same for both, a single component is used to represent both ER and physical files, with distinct instances for each: \

*   If disk is to be retained, determine from AT inventory whether it should be associated with an existing physical folder (the disk may or may not have been separated from this folder). For disks that had been in a folder with other materials and/or for disks whose subject matter aligns with that of other materials described at the component level, add disk as an instance at that component level, rather than entering as a separate component. \

*   If disk is to be retained and has liner notes, move the liner notes from the DVD to a folder in the collection and make sure in AT to create an instance for both the disk location and the folder at the appropriate component level in AT. If there is already a folder related to the DVD, put the liner notes into that folder and indicate that there are liner notes in a S+C note at the component level.  \

*   For disks to be retained that were not separated from a folder containing other materials, and for which there is no existing component that relates to the content, assign disk to an appropriate series and place in the inventory, creating a new component for the disk (or range of disks). Create instance with box and disk #. If box number is temporary, make sure to update box number at end of processing. (At end of processing, or before, transferred disks should be moved to a mixed transferred disk [dmx_] box). \

*   For all disks transferred, add a Scope and Content note indicating the original disk format. \

*   When disk inscription differs significantly from content of disks, use a descriptive title and indicate the inscription in the Scope and Content note. \

*   Sometimes files from a single disk relate to more than one series or subject in the inventory. Processing Archivist must use discretion as to whether to create a single, separate component for the combined disk, or whether to assign multiple components (and then create instances for the same disk for each component). \

*   If Processing Archivist cannot preview a disk prior to imaging:
    *   Processing Archivist creates temporary component for the disk in AT that will be revised once disk contents have been reviewed and permanently assigned to a series/place in inventory (or deaccessioned); indicates this in Disk Inventory and an email;
    *   Digital Archivist extracts files from disk in order to view files, places extracted files on shared drive for review, updates Disk Inventory, emails Processing Archivist that disk(s) are ready for review.

For disks to be retained, Processing Archivist prints label with disk identifier and places it on disk case. If there is not a separate row for the disk in the Disk Inventory, Processing Archivist creates one for each disk to be retained, and completes all relevant fields in Disk Inventory.

For disks to be discarded, Processing Archivist updates Disk Inventory with this information. It is not necessary to print a label for disks to be discarded. If there are more than one disk to be discarded for an accession, a single row may be used to communicate that a range of disks are to be discarded.

Processing Archivist emails Digital Archivist indicating that disks have been previewed and are ready for pick-up.


### If digital files have not yet been processed when finding aid is to be published:


*   Indicate that there are unprocessed disks at component-level in Repository Processing Note. 
*   Add collection-level Processing Note indicating that digital files are still in process.

**_Instances_** \
For all electronic files that have been transferred from removable media, the location of the physical disk should be entered as an instance in AT. \
 \
For electronic files that are uploaded to CA, follow standard protocol for adding digital object instances and links in AT. These instructions can be found in: [Tools and How-Tos: Archivists' Toolkit Processes_IN PROGRESS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HLUzCtDQ-M18ShhRnNTYw9S9Rtm9zUubOUd3eIp9yxU/edit?usp=sharing) \


Once Digital Archivist returns disks to Processing Archivist, Processing Archivist puts transferred disks into a mixed transferred disk box (prefix is dmx_), updating AT instance with final location of transferred disks and in Disk Inventory.

Instance format for disks is as follows:

Type = Computer Disks \
Container Type 1 = BOX \
Container Type 1 indicator = disk box where disk will finally reside--e.g., dmx_1. \
Container Type 2 = DISK. \
Container Type 2 indicator = disk ID or range of disk IDs. \
 \
**_Component-level S+C note_**

Processing Archivist adds scope and content note at component level regarding format of original disk (e.g., DVD), format of original files (e.g., TIF, WordPerfect), and description of disk contents.

Example: Images of Kalil Studio projects in the form of TIF files were migrated from CD-R. . Selected images from these disks were printed and mounted on foam core for the 2001 Kalil Retrospective exhibition.

For files that are uploaded to CA, CA rather than AT should be used for detailed item-level description.

**_Component-level Repository Processing Note_**

At component level, indicate disk ID or range of disk IDs. Also indicate here that files have been uploaded to CA.

**_Top Level_**

In AT, the presence of digital files should be reflected in several top-level notes, including: 



*   Scope and Content
*   Other Finding Aid
*   Conditions Governing Access
*   Genre/subject (ex., “electronic mail”)
*   Deaccession

 

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Scope and Content Note</span>_ \
The presence of electronic files should be included in the S&C note. \
Example:


    _Digital material is described at the folder level--that is, a single folder title may represent more than one digital file._

Example:


    _The collection includes twenty floppy disks containing drafts of Vidich's autobiography, With a Critical Eye._

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Other Finding Aid Note</span>_

For electronic files that are uploaded to CA, provide link to items from this collection in CA. Instructions for doing so can be found in [Tools and How-Tos: Archivists' Toolkit Processes_IN PROGRESS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HLUzCtDQ-M18ShhRnNTYw9S9Rtm9zUubOUd3eIp9yxU/edit?usp=sharing)

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Conditions Governing Access Note</span>_ \
For electronic files that are not to be uploaded to CA, use this note to instruct researchers to contact archives to view electronic files. \
Example:


    _Collection is open for research use. Digital files can be accessed onsite at The New School Archives. Please contact archivist@newschool.edu for appointment._

If there is a mix of some files that are to be uploaded to CA and some that will be accessed on site only, use both notes, in revised form (e.g., “Some digital files can be accessed onsite . . . “). \


If files on disk are restricted, indicate in AT according to similar convention as for restricted physical files.

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Extent and dates</span>_

Update extent and dates to include new material, including retained disk count. 

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Genre/subject</span>_

Add type of electronic file here.

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deaccession Note</span>_

For deaccessioned disks, add general deaccession note in AT (a single entry for a range of disks is fine). Also, for deaccessioned disks remove any remaining Repository Processing notes and/or instances.

For large groups of electronic files, or on other occasions, it may be determined useful to link to a disk file list from the AT record. **[MORE TO COME ON THIS]**


## _Media Processing_


### Once disks have been transferred to Digital Archives, options for Digital Processing: 

Digital Archivist references Disk Inventory for Processing Archivist appraisal decision.:



*   Retain--Onsite access only 
*   Retain--Import access files Collective Access
*   Do not Retain--Discard


### After files have been transferred from disk to shared drive:


*   Digital Archivist transfers files from disks to shared drive:
    *   Files that could not be reviewed prior to imaging go into "Dig_acc_to_be_processed/requires_further_assessment"
    *   Files that are ok for CA upload go into "Dig_acc_to_be_processed/okay_for_ca"
    *   Files that are to be retained but not going into CA are immediately transferred to Access and Preservation.
*   File names that are transferred from disks are not changed, except insofar as to remove offending characters (Digital Archivist does this).
*   After transferring files from disk, Digital Archivist delivers transferred disks to the Archives.
*   Processing Archivist adds transferred disks into a mixed transferred disk box (prefix (dmx_[1, 2, 3 . . . ]), adding box barcode to AT record.
*   Processing Archivist updates disk box location in Disk Inventory and in **AT instance** with final location of transferred disks, and then moves completed rows for transferred disks into Completed.
*   When disks for an entire collection have been completed, Digital Archivist (or Processing Archivist) moves the completed rows for that collection into a separate spreadsheet and files the spreadsheet in the collection folder on the shared drive.
*   When dmx_ box is full, Assistant Archivist sends it offsite.

Files that are to be uploaded to Collective Access:


*   1-10 = Processing Archivist
*   >10 = Digital Archivist completes batch upload.
*   If files are for upload to CA, upload must be completed before files are moved to access/preservation, and before row in Disk Inventory is moved to Completed tab.

After upload to CA and for files retained but not to be uploaded, Digital Archivist:


*   Moves files to access (digital_access) and preservation (:M) directories
*   Moves disk images to preservation collection folder in preservation files directory, and moves extracted files (retained in folders titled by disk, using disk identifier as title) to appropriate access collection folder in access files directory.


## _Describing electronic files in CA_

As a rule, detailed item-level cataloging is better to go into Collective Access than into the finding aid (AT). If cataloging work has been done in an Excel file for a large amount of digital material, this information can be imported into CA. 


However, in instances where electronic records are to be retained but not to be added to CA, there must be sufficient description in AT to communicate what will be found in these files.

CA catalog record should be created during processing by Processing Archivist at the time that AT description is finalized.
