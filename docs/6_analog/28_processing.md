# Introduction 

Processing is the work archives workers carry out in preparation for providing archival collections to researchers.

It includes physical work, such as protecting and storing materials, as well as intellectual work, including analyzing and writing descriptions of the materials. This manual will describe the physical work involved in processing. See the manual "[Processing: Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OxvOx04uJot2g3pDynI4MLuxkcYpa7ImffUMgFj-EBs/edit?usp=sharing)" for information on the other piece of processing. 

Archival materials can be analog, such as paper, videotape, audio cassettes, fabric samples, or film/photographic materials. They can also be digital, such as computer files. You will work with both analog and digital materials in the Archives.

Processing of analog materials sometimes includes re-housing materials in acid-free folders and boxes, removing paper clips, dividing overfilled folders, labeling folders with pencil, putting identifying stamps on the folders, etc.

For some small collections, this is a very simple task that may be completed in less than a day. For other larger or more complex collections, you may work on processing tasks for a week or more. You may also finish processing a collection someone else started.

# Rehousing

## Box Sizes

The size of the folders used determines the size of the box. The folder should fit snugly inside the box without the sides of the box crushing or bending the folder. If your folder is sliding around inside the box, it is too small for that size box. 

**RC = records carton**. These are the large square boxes that have completely detachable lids. We typically use these boxes for offsite storage of office files.

**AB = archival box.** A document or legal-size box. These are the shiny or buff neutrally colored boxes with hinged lids usually associated with storing archival materials. You may also hear them referred to as “Hollinger boxes.”

**SF = small flat.** The smallest of our oversize boxes, these are often used for material that does not fit into an AB or RC, or that is best stored lying down rather than upright.

**OS = oversize**. Depending on the number of x’s following the abbreviation OS you may be working with incrementally larger sized flat boxes. These boxes all have detachable lids.

**MC = map case**. You may also hear these referred to as **_flat files_**. They are the metal drawers for especially large, flat two-dimensional items. They are designed to hold oversize drawings and documents that are 30 x 40 inches. All materials stored in the map cases should be in an appropriately sized archival folder, never loose.

**Tube (no abbreviation).** As a last resort for items that are too big for the flat files, we will roll them up and store them in tubes. These are primarily used for posters.

## Mixed boxes

Mixed boxes are used to hold material that takes up much less than a whole box. Mixed boxes are particularly helpful for housing oversized items if there are only a few of them in the collection. For instructions on adding material to a mixed box see “[Workflow for: Archivists Toolkit Processes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HLUzCtDQ-M18ShhRnNTYw9S9Rtm9zUubOUd3eIp9yxU/edit?usp=sharing).”

## Folders

Use legal-size folders with legal-size boxes and letter-size folders with letter-size boxes; do not put letter-size folders in legal-size boxes. The folders will shift or slide during movement if there is significant space within the box, contributing to wear on the contents.

Archival materials should not slump over in their folders. If they do, it means that there is too much empty space in the box. If there is a lot of room (several inches), empty slide boxes or foam may be inserted into the box. If there is less than several inches, a spacer can be constructed out of heavy weight acid-free paper or cardboard. If there is very little room and materials are still slumping over, creating dividers and placing them throughout the box is helpful for creating support, especially when the box contains materials of varying sizes and dimensions.

Please note that we do not always transfer records into archival folders. This decision is made on a case-by-case basis depending on the age and condition of the records, among other factors. Do not transfer records into archival folders unless instructed to do so.

## Box openings and folder orientations

  </tr>
</table>


Items inside folders:

Photos and images should all be oriented so that the image **_is not upside down when the folder is opened._** Images oriented on their sides within the folder, should always face the **_same direction, with the top of the image at the left_ (and if there is text on the page, the top of the page faces left).**

Holding folder upright, papers/photos/all materials lying sideways in the folder should have their top toward the left of the folder; materials not lying on their side should have their top toward the top of the folder.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dcjyt9faTFIktIJV7vU0Sw85m4Rx6EGL/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

In general, put smaller materials up front in folders. Very small materials should be enclosed in a mini-folder made from interleaving paper.

**Map Case Folder Orientation**

For oversize materials that live in the map case (aka flat files), in terms of orientation, each folder should be placed with in flap towards the rear of the drawer.

# Numbering & Labeling

LABEL ALL CONTAINERS!

Even when mid-project and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">you</span> know what is in an unmarked box, never, ever, EVER leave a box or folder or other kind of container that has something in it unlabeled. ALWAYS put a post-it or other kind of temporary label clearly identifying the contents on the FRONT of the box. Even if you plan to discard the contents later on, if there is something inside that container, label the container.

When you put an item, container or anything else, on a shelf, make sure that its label is right side up, facing OUTWARD, and is clearly visible to the naked eye. You should be able to read the label easily without having to turn the item to locate the label.

CROSS OUT LABELS ON EMPTY CONTAINERS!

Whenever you have emptied a folder, box, or any container that is to be saved for reuse (or even to be thrown away):



1. In pencil, CROSS OUT any and all information (and stamps) written on now-empty containers—there should be NO empty containers (meaning boxes, folders, binders, ANYthing with labels or notes on the outside that once contained something inside) with collection titles or any other markings on them that are not crossed out.
2. PUT AWAY empty containers. Put them in their appropriate spot (ask Wendy or Jenny, if you're not positive where they belong). DO NOT leave empty folders and boxes lying around unless you plan to use them again SOON.


### Box Numbering

We use many different size boxes in the New School Archives. Because we use the box sizes as a way of identifying the locations of archival materials, it is important to be accurate in box numbering (see section on [box sizes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QiELDnVVdYJQ2y7oaD2sXEMPHmUbU6Iw5T01UMBoI6w/edit#heading=h.vo99avdqykir) for more information.)

All boxes are numbered, even if the collection only consists of one box. In this case, it would simply be “Box 1.”

Rules for box numbering:

1. For regular RCs, ABs, and smallest flat boxes [~13 x 16] the numbering begins with “Box 1” and continues for each subsequent regular RC, AB, and small flat box. Each collection or record group starts at box 1 for that collection
2. OS boxes:

OSx = start at OSx-1 and increase sequentially

OSxx = start at OSxx-1 and increase sequentially

OSxxx = start at OSxxx-1 and increase sequentially

1. Mixed boxes:

    Collections or portions of collections with items that take up less than a full box should go into Mixed KA, Mixed PC, or Mixed NS boxes, depending on whether they are KA, PC, or NS collections . Mixed boxes start with box 1, OSx-1, OSxx-1, or OSxxx-1, depending on size.


    Collections in mixed boxes intellectually remain a part of the collection they are a part of, even though they are physically stored with material from other collections.


    Mixed boxes are numbered in the following format: [first letter of repository (e.g. New School, Kellen, Parsons)]_[box size if oversized, otherwise skip]_[sequential number]


<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Examples:</span>
p_OSxx-2
k_1
n_OSx-1

All boxes sent offsite are barcoded and the barcodes are entered into AT (instructions for entering locations in AT can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HLUzCtDQ-M18ShhRnNTYw9S9Rtm9zUubOUd3eIp9yxU/edit?usp=sharing).) These boxes are also entered into a Filemaker database to track delivery requests and returns, see [Workflow: Filemaker Offsite Database](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14t3nEomt_Gcbrnlta6Dzi9DDbFLZg0KjOq-Gj014sbw/edit?usp=sharing).


### Folder Numbering   

Each folder within a box or file drawer receives a title and a number. The number indicates the box number and the location of the folder within the box or drawer relative to all the other folders in that box or drawer. No folder should ever be left without a numerical designation.

Each folder number is comprised of three components: the number of the box, a decimal point, and numerical location of the folder in the box.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Example</span>:	The third folder in a Box 2 would be expressed as: **2.3**

The folder numbering begins at 1 at the beginning of each new box, and increases sequentially by one unit until arriving at the very last folder in the rear of the box or the bottom of the drawer (the folder at the very top of the drawer is designated 1). Do not skip numbers unless otherwise instructed.

Folder numbers are written in pencil on the far right top corner of a legal or document size folder. For large flat folders, it is written on the far right side of the closed end of the folder. Do not write out the word “folder”; just the number.

Please make sure to write neatly and to press down hard enough that the numbering is easily legible. This is important because researchers use the folder number to cite archival materials in their research

Typically, numbering is done toward the end of processing because folders are often relocated during processing.

#### Oversize folder numbering

Numbers on oversize folders should follow this format:

OSx-1.1


#### Map case folder numbering

Folders stored in the map cases should be numbered in the following format:

[“Map Case”]  [letter designation as to which file bank]  [drawer #] . [folder #]

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Example</span>:	MC A 1.1


#### Hive storage numbering

For rolled materials that are housed in one of the Hives:

Rolls should be protected by an exterior roll layer of acid free, unbuffered paper.

Write the same kind of information on the roll as you would on a folder, on the horizontal left edge (so that when you pull the tube out partially from the hive, you can easily see the label).

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Example</span>:	Hive B 2.15


### Folder Titling

Folder titles should begin at the far left top corner (or, on oversize folders, on the bottom left corner). Folder titles should match the description of that material in AT. If the material from one series or file takes up more than one folder, follow the title with “1 of x” (x being the number of folders containing material of that description.)

For large series or folders that have a repeated title (or part of title), create a stamp for the repeated part, to eliminate having to write it over and over again. During processing, you can use a shorthand in pencil on the folder—when ready, create the stamp with the series/repeated title on the stamp at the appropriate level beneath the collection title.


### Folder stamping

There is a stamp available that can be altered for assigning the name of collections to each folder. The stamp includes the repository name, collection name, and collection number. Ask Anna, Agnes, Wendy or Jenny to show you how to make a new stamp. Everything should be removed from a folder before stamping it.

# Specific Formats and Preservation Issues


## Newspaper and Magazine Clippings

Handling of newspaper and magazine clippings depends on the type, condition, and nature of the clipping.

Newsprint clippings should always be completely separated by interleaving paper from other, non-newsprint material in a folder to prevent acid migration, the discoloration often seen on materials in contact with newsprint or other highly acidic paper.

Often we trim clippings so that only the relevant article remains. Occasionally, however, we will retain an entire page or newspaper, if we think it will be of interest to researchers, or if it gives important context to an article. Make sure to check for publication information before trimming and discarding extraneous sections. The citation**, _including page number_**, can be written directly on the clipping in pencil using brackets. This information is important to researchers; _please be careful not to destroy information that researchers need to accurately cite the clipping in their research_.

For clippings in poor condition (ripped, crumbling, extremely brittle):

*   Photocopy the clipping onto acid-free paper and discard the original, unless the original is in color or is from a regional or obscure publication. Original newsprint in poor condition may be enclosed in Mylar with an interleaving backing for support and absorption of acid
*   Remember to retain citation information when copying; it may be necessary to check the back of the clipping for identifying information. Before discarding the original, check that all parts of the article have been copied and columns are not truncated. Also, check that accompanying graphics have reproduced in a way that ensures researchers can get the necessary information from them. For example, a photograph that reproduces as a big black square on the page is not helpful.
*   If copying, it may be necessary to experiment with the copier settings to achieve the best readability. Choosing the “Photograph” setting often achieves better results than the “Text” setting. For extremely poor legibility, the clipping can be scanned and printed. 


## Photographic Materials

Analog photographic materials include slides, negatives and other types of transparencies as well as prints. Digital images as electronic files are not included in this discussion.

Always wear clean blue nitrile gloves whenever you are handling unenclosed photographic materials. Ordinarily, gloves are not used in the New School Archives, but it is important to use gloves to prevent oils and salts from transferring from our skin to the photographs, which will eventually damage them.

We often enclose photographic prints in a neutral plastic you will hear referred to as Mylar, even if isn’t technically Mylar. Mylar comes in different sizes. The usual practice is to place prints in Mylar sleeves appropriate to the size of the print you are trying to protect. However, for prints of multiple sizes residing in the _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">same folder</span>_, use the same size Mylar for all prints in the folder. Like the folders, there should be no overhang; the print should not protrude from the sleeve. If it is protruding or if you will need to bend or force the print inside the enclosure, you need to select the next larger size sleeve. If there are a large number of photographic prints, please check before proceeding to place all of the prints in Mylar as the sleeves contribute to an increase in volume and weight of boxes. It is also expensive. 

Please note that no more than 10-12 photographic prints should be housed in the same folder.

Photographic transparencies (with the exception of slides) and negatives should be stored in neutral paper envelopes.

Slides should be stored in special slide sleeves. Please be certain when inserting slides into the sleeves that all slides are oriented the same way, so that the researcher doesn’t need to twist the sleeve around. The shiny side of all slides should face the front of the sleeve—the emulsion side, which is not shiny, should face the back of the sleeve. Again, this will prevent the researcher from needing to flip the sleeve around.

If you are transferring any photographic materials out of old slide cases, envelopes, etc., please look for information written on these enclosures before discarding them. They may provide valuable information about the photographs. We may ask you to photocopy this information onto acid-free paper and retain just the copy with the materials, or we may decide its best just to keep the original.

## Paper-based Documents (Correspondence, Drawings, etc.)

Very often, these materials require nothing beyond placement in the appropriate size archival folders, or they may remain in their non-archival folders depending on the judgment of the supervising archivist.

**_Do not use plastic paper clips to keep materials together_**. Paper clips leave indentations in archival materials and are prone to breaking. Use a sheet of interleaving paper folded in half to hold formerly clipped materials physically together.

Mylar may be used for fragile paper documents such as letters if the letters appear to be in danger of ripping during handling (for example, there are already tears in the paper). If paper documents are placed in Mylar, put a sheet of acid-free interleaving paper into the sleeve underneath the document if it is one-sided. Mylar **_should not be used_** for materials featuring **_friable media_**, such as pencil, pastel or crayon. The static charge will “lift” the medium off the paper.

If you encounter materials folded up resist the temptation to unfold them—cracking or weakening of paper occurs when unfolding. Sometimes pages can be unfolded without doing too much harm—but please ask Jenny or Wendy for help before attempting this. If you try to unfold a paper document and hear “cracking” or see that tears or other forms of visible stress are occurring, stop immediately. Never unfold tracing paper, blueprints, or any other type of “treated” paper or brittle paper unless specifically instructed by your supervisor.

You may need to transfer unfolded items into larger size folders. Do not attempt to jam unfolded materials back into a folder that is now too small to accommodate them.

Some materials will require more intensive conservation work, such as humidifying or pressing for some time under a weighted object, to flatten creases.

## Architectural plans and drawings

*   Where possible, keep like drawings from project together.
*   Sort first by project, then by size, type and media. Some common types: freehand sketch, line drawing, plan, elevation, section, detail.
*   Further subdivide by whether drawings are pencil, pen, marker, or photoprint
*   From a conservation standpoint, it is better for materials to not be mixed; pen and pencil drawings/sketches should not be touching one other, so when kept in the same folder they should be divided by interleaving paper.
*   Determine what is to flatten versus what stays rolled.
*   If a drawing or set of plans or photoprint is too large to fit into the flat file (map case), keep it rolled and:
    *   wrap in acid-free paper with the drawing facing inwards
    *   tie with archival ribbon
    *   write collection and “folder” information on the outer paper so that it can be easily read without unrolling
    *   store in long rectangular boxes, if going offsite
    *   store just in its paper wrapper in the hive or on the shelves in row 1
*   For materials that fit into a map case drawer or OS box:
    *   Some materials respond well just to flattening without steaming: for these, use blotter paper between stacks of materials, with a fair amount of weight on top of these (two high stacks of filled RCs should be fine).
    *   For really curled materials, if possible to do this without damaging them, put them face down, unrolling them in the opposite direction.
    *   If there are a lot of small tissue sketches, you may be able to just folder without having to steam individually. Once things are foldered and put away, the weight of folders on top of each other will help relax the paper a bit over time.
    *   Use your judgment about steaming -- most tissues and photoprints respond well to it, hit them with steaming before laying them out for flattening, sandwiched between blotter paper. The blotter paper helps absorb any residual moisture in the paper.

## Fasteners, Paperclips, etc.

It is important that items found fastened together, stay together, even if you are removing the fastener. Do not rearrange the items found fastened together. Leave them in the order you found them in.

### Rubber bands 

Always remove rubber bands encountered during processing. Use interleaving paper folded in half to keep the items held together with the rubber band as a unit if necessary. If a rubber band is stuck to paper or photographs, please alert your supervisor. Do not attempt to tear it off as you may damage archival materials.

### Paper clips

Leave metal clips that are in good condition in place unless instructed otherwise. If the metal paper clip is rusty, remove it and use interleaving paper folded in half to keep the items held together with the paper clip as a unit if necessary. Do not slide the rusty paperclip off as you normally would. Instead, apply a small amount of upwards pressure to move the clip off without it touching the paper. Ask your supervisor for guidance if you are unsure.

If you encounter plastic paper clips, please remove and replace with folded interleaving paper.

### Brads, pins, staples, etc.

Leave as is unless rusty or otherwise instructed.

### Sticky notes, Post-Its, etc.

Any paper adhered to a document using a temporary adhesive should be removed. Photocopy the note as it appears on the document, then remove and discard the sticky note. Include the photocopy with the remainder of the materials.
 

**_Never_** apply sticky notes directly to archival materials while processing..


## When should I use Mylar?


*   For photographic prints: Mylar sleeves should be used for photographic prints. It will prevent oils from our skin from transferring to the photographic paper, leaving a fingerprint. However, if there are a large number of photographic prints, please check before proceeding to place all of it in Mylar as the sleeves contribute to an increase in volume and weight of boxes. It is also expensive.
*   When an item features smaller pieces glued onto a larger surface and the smaller components are at risk of falling off or getting lost.
*   For newspaper clippings when it is desirable to retain the original instead of making a copy and throwing away the original. Some examples include color clippings, or clippings that have been annotated with pen or pencil. In general, it is not necessary to use Mylar on glossy magazine paper.
*   For fragile paper documents such as letters if the letters appear to be in danger of ripping during handling (for example, there are already tears in the paper). If paper documents are placed in Mylar, put a sheet of acid-free interleaving paper into the sleeve along with the document.

Mylar <span style="text-decoration:underline;">should not be used</span> for materials featuring friable media, such as pencil or crayon. The static charge will “lift” the pencil off the paper.

Keep in mind, Mylar is expensive and careful consideration should be given before deciding to use it.


# Weeding

Sometimes it is appropriate to remove and discard items in a collection. Below is a general guide to what can be discarded. If you are unsure whether to discard something, ask. Any paper-based material being discarded that originated from The New School should be shredded. A box for collecting material to be shredded is located under the assistant archivist’s desk.

The archives does not retain documents that are considered letters of transmittal or documents concerning routine transactions, unless they are attached to or part of a group of materials that depend upon the transmittal letter for context. What does this mean? Standard, template-type responses to common requests. For example, cover letters send with a catalog when someone writes and requests a catalog. Acknowledgement letters when there is some other record of a gift or donation. Large numbers of the exact same letter with only the addressee changed. In these cases, a sample is sufficient. 

If there are too many duplicates of certain material they are weeded. This depends on the date and format of the material. See the manual “[Processing: Description in Archivists Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OxvOx04uJot2g3pDynI4MLuxkcYpa7ImffUMgFj-EBs/edit?usp=sharing)” for a detailed guide to weeding based on format and age. If you have any questions about a particular situation, ask.
