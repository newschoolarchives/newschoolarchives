When a new collection comes into the Archives, it should be accessioned immediately, as described below. As soon as possible after initial accessioning, an archivist should create a STEP 1 processing plan with instructions to inventory the material and to conduct some basic physical processing tasks.

# Creating Accession Records

The instructions below sequentially follow the layout of fields in AT, which don’t necessarily make the most logical sense in terms of our accessioning workflow. However, each of these fields must be completed. 



1. **Resource Identifier**: Create a unique accession number if the accession is not an accretion to a pre-existing accession. You may wish to search in the AT Accession module for similar pre-existing recent accessions before creating a new record.
    1. The first field should be the year of the accession, e.g. 2017.
    2. The second field should identify the ‘collections category,’ e.g. PC, NS, KA.
    3. The third field should identify the next consecutive available number for that ‘collections category’ for the year you are entering. Use a zero as a place holder for single digits.
    4. The fourth field should remain blank.
2. **Accession Date**: The accession date is the date the accession came into the Archives’ physical custody, e.g. 2017-5-12.
3. **Resources linked to this accession**: These resources are generally identified (whether already existing or created anew) later in the accessioning process, but if the related resource already exists and this is a certainty, link the resource(s) to the accession record.
4. **Resource Type**: Indicate the resource type from the dropdown menu.
5. **Title**: Indicate the title of the resource. Spell out names and include abbreviations, too. This will help with searching when we are trying to find similar accessions that may belong together. For example, Schools of Public Engagement Bachelor's Program for Adults and Transfer Students (BPATS) records
6. **Extent**: Indicate the extent in linear footage if possible. You might need to hold off on this until you have transferred materials into boxes. If it’s a very small accession (less than .4 linear feet or one AB box), feel free to use items.
7. **Container Summary**: In the container summary, provide more information about the size of the collection and its containers. For example, 12 syllabi or 3 boxes.
8. **Repository**: Select the appropriate repository from the dropdown list. Be aware that the default is Kellen Design Archives. 
9. **Date Expression**: For date expression, be as accurate as possible without being incorrect. Decade ranges are fine. Don’t bother with the beginning and end dates. 
10. **Deaccessions**: The deaccession fields are only used once processing begins, so skip that for now.
11. **Locations**: Use the location fields to identify where you are placing the boxes. Before you put the boxes anywhere, make sure that you label them with the accession number, either on a sticky note or directly onto a light-colored box. In the note field, indicate a box number and a box size, e.g. AB, RC, etc.
12. **General Accession Note**: Provide additional details about who transferred the records, under what conditions, from which location, etc. Include the person’s title, role, or relationship to the records. Contact information for the donor or transfer coordinator should also be placed in this field. 


## Accession Notes

Use as needed. Note that the inventory field should only be used for an initial box-level inventory. File level inventories should always be in the resource record.


## Acknowledgements, Restrictions and Processing Tasks tab

Complete these fields:



1. **Processing plan: **Use this field to indicate if different parts of an accession are in different stages of processing (this usually applies when an accession is linked to more than one resource.) This field should _not_ be used to document processing plans.
2. **Processing status: **Update to reflect current state of processing. Initially, “Not processed” should be selected. When the accession has been inventoried, it can be changed to “Step 1 completed” and so on. Once the FA for all related collections have been processed, change status to “Completed.”

**Processing priority (optional): **Use the high/medium/low rubric to assign processing priority; ignore the 1-7 scale. 


# Inventorying & basic processing

New accessions should be inventoried in Archivists Toolkit before being sent offsite. An archivist should set up the resource record and write STEP 1 instructions for a student worker. If the accession is going to form a new collection, create a new resource record (see the manual [Description in Archivists Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OxvOx04uJot2g3pDynI4MLuxkcYpa7ImffUMgFj-EBs) for more information on creating a resource record.) 

If the accession is part of a larger collection or records group, as will often be the case with institutional records, a new series-level component should be added to the resource record for that accession, titled by accession number. In either case, create a component for each box in the accession--indicating shelf locations and/or, when sending offsite, adding barcodes to the box instance.

If the accession inventory is going to be integrated into an existing resource record inventory, indicate the accession number in the repository processing note for those components. For example, if you are processing an accession of student work from the Lighting Design program and are adding the projects as components in PC.02.01.02, Series IV, Lighting Design, make sure to indicate the accession number in the repository processing note for each new component you add.

The following tasks should be included in STEP 1 instructions for new accessions:



*   Folder level inventory of everything in accession
*   Flagging and identifying of optical media. The accessioning archivist should determine whether to include instructions at this stage for assigning disk IDs and adding them to the tracking spreadsheet or whether this will wait until a further level of physical processing.
    *   If the accession is large with a complex file structure, or the accessioning archivist believes disk processing will occur before the next stage of physical processing, disk IDs should be assigned and tracked. See instructions in the manual [Archivist's Toolkit_etcetera_Hybrid and Born-Digital Collections_IN PROGRESS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bn5lLectubLIegL7AR6ie59aJW9xc_qla8g70MJxVvg/edit?usp=sharing). Disk IDs should be noted in the repository processing note at the folder level, and written on a flag that is placed in the folder.
    *   If the accessioning archivist determines that disk IDs and tracking are unnecessary at the time of inventorying, STEP 1 should simply include instructions to flag disks in the folder and add a  note in the repository processing note at the folder level indicating presence and number of discs in that folder 
*   Any material that is too large for the folder it is in should be moved to larger folder
*   Fix slumping folders and material by inserting cardboard pieces or spacers
*   Sleeve photographs, unless there is a large quantity of photos, in which case an archivist should be consulted before rehousing
*   If the accession is not personal papers, try to identify the person or office that is responsible for the creation of materials

Once Step 1 tasks are complete, the processing status for the accession record should be updated to indicate this.


## Digital materials

When digital files have been delivered, minor technical processing should occur (DROID report, file normalization, read-only setting). The files can then await processing at a later time. When this work is completed, the processing status should stay "not yet processed,' but a note to say that this work was completed on transfer should be added to the Disposition Note in the accession record.

The location of newly accessioned digital files should be indicated as either “Staging Active” or “Staging Backlog.” This should be used instead of 'ASC Shared Drive,' which isn't specific and requires an additional note. The material will only be moved to preservation drive after it has been assigned a resource record and processed. Location does not need to be updated later on the accession record, only the processing status requires editing.
