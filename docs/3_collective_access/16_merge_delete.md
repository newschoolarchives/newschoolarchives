# Merge and Transfer Media in CA 
{: .no_toc }

To merge records and transfer media representations in CA into an existing record, go to the object record that you want to merge _from_ and click the delete button in the upper right corner of the record:

The following pop up appears:

Select “transfer references to” then begin typing the identifier of the record you want to merge _into_.

In this example, I am transferring relationships from “For Pedestrians Only (part 2 of 3)” into “For Pedestrians Only (part 1 of 3).” Be sure to select and highlight the record title when it appears. Click yes to confirm that the record should be deleted. 

Next, go to the first record, the one that you selected to transfer the references from the deleted record. You should see the media representation(s) from the deleted record, as well as any media representation(s) that were already related to the base record. Related collections and related entities fields are also transferred, and when the records merge some of these relationships may be duplicated. Delete any duplicate relationships.
