## Course Descriptions

_History of collecting:_ 

Around 2015, we began working with IT to get course descriptions from various data into the archives, now that most course information is not found in printed or PDF catalogs. An IT staff member provided us with direct csv exports from proprietary Banner database and created a tool called makecatalog to transform the data into a searchable PDF. In Fall 2017, we gained access to course data available through the Tableau platform. Below are instructions to export the data from Banner through Tableau.


## Stage 1. Schedule annual collection every August


## Stage 2. Download Data

Step 1. Login at [https://mydata.newschool.edu](https://mydata.newschool.edu) (Access may need to be granted by [itcentral@newschool.edu](mailto:itcentral@newschool.edu). Contact: Max Carradine in IT: carradim@newschool.edu). 

Step 2. Go to Workbooks > Course Data > Course Data Dashboard 

Step 3. Select Term (semester) in the right pane, and select “all” for all other categories.

Step 4. Click Download - Data - Download all rows as a text file. Open resulting .csv file in Microsoft Excel and save as .xls.


## Stage 3. Parse Data

Step 1. Create tabs for each College.
