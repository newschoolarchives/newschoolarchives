# Stage 1. Create Accession Record in Archivists' Toolkit 
[See related manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JeWYhBKSVplsblHkcSIzvc65qt56MIZV5eRKrwXmkpI/edit).

# Stage 2. Communicate with department contacts annually to confirm collection of theses.

## Department Contacts and Permission Forms
*   Department contacts should be confirmed annually. 
*   Permission forms set access and restriction parameters for all media, as well as standards for file naming, file types, and other requirements. The same department form should be used each year, changing the date and reviewing the language to make edits where needed. 

## Departments:

### MFA Design + Technology 

*   [Permissions Form](https://docs.google.com/a/newschool.edu/forms/d/1UpxPUW2vhWE7WYNqDptjhyTmCu7bh5qB0ONPdgnjHaU/edit?usp=sharing) (usually send early May)
*   Contacts as of June 2019:
    *   Andrew Zornoza azornoza@gmail.com or [zorna687@newschool.edu](mailto:zorna687@newschool.edu))
    *   Louisa Campbell campbell.louisa@gmail.com, campbell@newschool.edu

### MFA Photography 

*   [Permissions Form](https://docs.google.com/a/newschool.edu/forms/d/1txTmdm4N4H6DxCNFjW-5RAxXJ_XPGdFSEyMrljeMBFQ/edit?usp=sharing) (send early August for summer program)
*   Contacts as of June 2019:
    *   Iris Stevens (stevensi@newschool.edu)
    *   Jim Ramer ([ramerj@newschool.edu](mailto:ramerj@newschool.edu))

### MFA Lighting Design

*   [Permissions Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNv7upUAJ0FaSvyYTvhRvYfk76I2zwRe1pRBJpsdUuJwv-9Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) (determine date to send out)
*   Contact(s) as of June 2019:
    *   Glenn Shrum ([shrumg@newschool.edu](mailto:shrumg@newschool.edu))

## Notes on Submissions:

*   When multiple students are associated with a thesis, they should only make one submission of files, though each student should complete and submit an electronic agreement.
*   Students should not use personal emails, only TNS addresses.
*   Students should not submit work if they decline. 

# Stage 3. Collect Files

Coordinate with department contacts to transfer thesis files. It is preferable that they bring the files on an external hard drive to archives office, but they can also be accepted via Google Drive.

# Stage 4. Review restricted and unrestricted material

After all responses are submitted, download spreadsheet of responses created from the Google Form. This spreadsheet will result in the following documents:

_Saved to K: Central Kellen share >related Collections folder_

*   The original downloaded form
*   An edited version of the downloaded form. The edited version will have a tab for each category of permissions:  
	1. immediately public  
	2. restricted to on-site for one year  
	3. restricted to staff for one year  
	4. declined.  
Note: Any student with an incomplete submission will be removed from this form, as will duplicate form submissions. Collaborations between students will be listed as one submission, any additional form responses will be removed from the spreadsheet.  

_Saved to Digital Archives > Collective Access > Import > Collection folder_

*   CA Thesis import spreadsheet. 

_Saved to Archivist_Toolkit > spreadsheet_import_

*   Sheet used for AT import of new series for Resource record

# Stage 5. Import to Collective Access
See related manual for import directions.

Note: There is one step in the import process that is specific to theses. All theses will be imported to Collective Access, regardless of their permissions status, _but,_ restricted theses will remain private for one year. The restricted theses should be associated with a set labeled like the following example: 'MFA D&T Theses restricted May 2020.' An additional calendar reminder should be added to the ADDA's schedule for the appropriate time. 

# Stage 6. Create/Update Resource Record in Archivists Toolkit

When a new batch of theses has been processed, a resource record must be created or updated with information about the new theses:

## Basic Description

*   Date expression
*   Inclusive dates
*   Accessions linked field (through the accession record)
*   Extent number (see related manual for calculating digital extent)
*   Container summary

## Notes, Etc.

*   Immediate source of acquisition

## Finding Aid Data

*   Dates revised in the Finding Aid Title field
*   Revision date
*   Revision description

Update these fields according to the [Archivists’ Toolkit Description manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OxvOx04uJot2g3pDynI4MLuxkcYpa7ImffUMgFj-EBs/edit?usp=sharing).

All newly accessioned theses, even those that are currently restricted and will not be uploaded to CA, should be entered in Archivists Toolkit.

## Restricted materials*

### Collection-level note

All thesis collections with restricted material should contain a collection-level **Conditions of Access** note indicating the presence of restricted material:

   * Collection is open for research use. Theses are available in electronic form only. Most of the collection is open for research use. For newly accessioned theses, some authors have requested that their theses not be made available online for one year from the date of submission, but have indicated that their theses may be viewed onsite in the New School Archives. In other instances, authors have opted to make their theses completely unavailable for viewing until one year from the date of submission. Please contact archivist@newschool.edu for appointment.

### Component-level note

When students donate their thesis, they can [choose the level of public access](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Yj3axC-haB2BXtCkRBvSNgrvcw2cuZiT8AK_aDUIe3Y/edit) they would like to provide to their work for the first year after the donation is made. Based on their selection, a component-level Scope & Content note should be added in AT indicating the level of access. 

**Examples:**

   * Upon request of the author, this thesis is unavailable until May 1, 2020.

   * Upon request of the author, this thesis is only accessible to researchers on-site at The New School Archives until May 1, 2020.

A double underscore ( __ ) should also be added to the ‘Note Label’ field so that the label type does not repeatedly appear in the finding aid. 

* This content was found in the section “Restricted Theses” in the [Description in Archivists Toolkit manual.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OxvOx04uJot2g3pDynI4MLuxkcYpa7ImffUMgFj-EBs/edit?usp=sharing)

### Deaccession note

### Deaccession Notes for Theses
This section can be found in the [Archivist's Toolkit_Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OxvOx04uJot2g3pDynI4MLuxkcYpa7ImffUMgFj-EBs/edit#) manual.

Thesis submissions should be reviewed for possible deaccessions. There are three common reasons for deaccessioning a thesis submission: 

*   **Incomplete submission**: The student failed to submit a written thesis along with their media. 
*   **No agreement form**: The student did not submit a permissions agreement to the archives.
*   **Missing files**: media cannot be opened due to missing data, or student did not submit any media along with their agreement form.

**Sample deaccession note for 2018 submissions**

**Notes**

  _Per field_

*   The Deaccession Date should be the year of the submission.
*   Student names are added to the Description section. 
*   Disposition refers to the date the files were deleted.   
_General_
*   A note should be added for each year of submissions. 
*   If there are multiple reasons for deaccessions, create a separate note for each category of disposition.
