Department Contacts and Permission Forms
Department contacts should be confirmed annually. 
Permission forms set access and restriction parameters for all media, as well as standards for file naming, file types, and other requirements. The same department form should be used each year, changing the date and reviewing the language to make edits where needed.

Images and Audiovisual Materials from Marketing & Communications Digital Assets Library (DAL) System
Images
The archives will transfer only selected projects, and from selected projects only selected images. (Currently testing this out with one category of projects: Student Life?)
For now, selections will be limited to come from “Public Collections” area of Bynder.
Design team will flag/tag best photos from each shoot. These could eventually be reviewed to consider for transfer to the archives.
DAL manager will mark image records in DAL that have been transferred to the archives.
DAL manager will indicate images that have come from the archives, placing the record identifier in “original filename” field.
Video
For the most part, the archives will only transfer video that is 10 years or older. (With exceptions, like: Vera List Center, Post-Election America?, Comic Series, and others). 
Releases will be in additional files under versions tab on item record. Releases will be transferred at time of video transfer.
Course Descriptions
Description
Around 2015, we began working with IT to get course descriptions from various data into the archives, now that most course information is not found in printed or PDF catalogs. An IT staff member provided us with direct csv exports from proprietary Banner database and created a tool called makecatalog to transform the data into a searchable PDF.
In Fall 2017, we gained access to course data available through the Tableau platform. Below are instructions to export the data from Banner through Tableau.
Directions
Request access to Tableau from itcentral@newschool.edu
Once access has been established, download course data from https://mydata.newschool.edu:
Go to Workbooks - Course data dashboard
Select Term (semester) in right pane, and select “all” for all other categories.
Click Download - Data - Download all rows as a text file, then open resulting csv file in Microsoft Excel. Generate Access PDF using Save As, and keep original csv as preservation file.

Collect Files
Coordinate with department contacts to transfer thesis files, it is preferable that they bring the files on an external hard drive to archives office, but they can also be accepted via Google Drive.
Theses
When multiple students are associated with a thesis, they should only make one submission of files, though each student should complete and submit an electronic agreement.
Students should not use personal emails, only TNS addresses.
Students should not submit work if they decline. 
Event Recordings
Physical permission forms should be collected from participants on-site at the time the event takes place, therefore the directions for collecting files and permissions are different than the workflow for department theses. The following directions should be communicated to the department contact annually:
Submitting Files to the Archive
Create a folder on the external hard drive that clearly indicates it contains the recordings for the archives. Something like this: FOR THE ARCHIVES_COMICS SYMPOSIA FALL 2017. 
Name all video files exactly according to the naming convention provided below. Make sure they are free of symbols (&*@$!? etc.), no commas, no periods (except right before file extension).
Name all permission form (a.k.a. release) files exactly the same way that you name the video files. (See below.)
Put releases into the same folder as the video files on the external drive. There should be releases covering every video that is transferred to the archives. If there is no release for a session, or if one is missing for a session that has more than one speaker, do not include that video in the folder. We cannot take any video without accompanying releases. 
Contact us at archivist@newschool.edu to arrange drop-off of the external drive.
 
Filenaming
The file naming convention for events should be as follows:
[DATE in this format: yyyymmdd][underscore][speaker's first name][underscore][speaker's last name].
The permission forms (releases) should be formatted exactly the same way as the event recording, so that the only difference will be the file extension (except for a session where there were two or more speakers--then file names won't quite match exactly). 
Here are a few examples:
20170912_David_Leopold
20171114_Mark_Newgarden_and_Paul_Karasik
The filename structure should also account for events with a title in addition to speaker name.

Review restricted and unrestricted material

Theses
After all responses are submitted, download spreadsheet of responses created from the Google Form. This spreadsheet will lead to the following documents:
Saved to Collections folder in K: Central Kellen share
The original downloaded form
An edited version of the downloaded form. The edited version will have a tab for each category of permissions: 
    1. immediately public 
    2. restricted to on-site for one year 
    3. restricted to staff for one year 
    4. declined. 
Note: Any student with an incomplete submission will be removed from this form, as will duplicate form submissions. Collaborations between students will be listed as one submission, any additional form responses will be removed from the spreadsheet.  
Saved to Digital Archives, Collective Access, Import, Collection folder
CA Thesis import spreadsheet. 
Saved to Archivist_Toolkit/spreadsheet_import
Sheet used for AT import of new series
Update Archivists Toolkit
When a new batch of theses is accessioned, the following fields of the Archivists Toolkit resource record for that collection must be updated:
Basic Description
Date expression
Inclusive dates
Accessions linked field (through the accession record)
Extent number
Container summary
Notes, Etc.
Immediate source of acquisition
Finding Aid Data
Dates revised in the Finding Aid Title field
Revision date
Revision description
Update these fields according to the Archivists’ Toolkit Description manual.
All newly accessioned theses, even those that are currently restricted and will not be uploaded to CA, should be entered in Archivists Toolkit.
Restricted materials
For guidelines on how to create notes indicating the presence of restricted material, see the section “Restricted Theses” in the Description in Archivists Toolkit manual.
